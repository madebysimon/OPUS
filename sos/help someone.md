## Help someone in a crisis 🫂
1. Safety first, respect and maintain boundaries
	> **Do not touch or even approach someone who is highly agitated or violent**. Also do not decide by yourself what is in the person's best interests.
	- Protect your own safety, physical and mental wellbeing before assisting others. Recognize your limits, be aware of your own needs and seek support for yourself.
		-  You **cannot** decide for another person whether or not he/she wants help
		- You **cannot** control how your effort is met, how other people respond to you
		- be honest with yourself about how much time and effort you can afford to spend in helping
	
	> **For your safety** - as well as that of others and the person in distress itself - decisions on their behalf should be left to trained professionals.

2. Be ready to recognize need for professional intervention
	- if you feel strongly uneasy or seriously concerned at any times do not hessitate and involve emergency services (see [suicide warning signs →](/suicide-warning-signs)) or [seek help by professionals →](#lifelines-and-phone-numbers)
		- Direct the person to professional help. Offer to accompany him/her to the next psychotherapist or emergency room or encourage him/her to call and make an appointment right then and there.

3. How to help
	- Take the person aside for undivided attention and to talk in private.
	- Listen **carefully** and with sensitivity in an open minded and **nonjudgmental** way. Do not argue.
	- **Be honest** and direct, do not lie. Share what you have observed and why it concerns you. For example:
		> "I've noticed that you've been missing a lot lately and you aren't answering your phone or text messages like you used to. I'm worried about you."
	- Note that distress often comes from conflicting feelings or demands.
	- Follow up. Let the person know that you'll be checking back with him or her later to see how things turned out.
	- Responding in a caring way to a person in distress can help prevent the distressed person's situation from escalating into a crisis.

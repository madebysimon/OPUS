> Lectures in 2021 have a single flaw leading to subpar content: most of them are created closed source.
> This leads to
> - sporting centristic "monodisciplinary" views
> - suffering from *false consensus* and *confirmation bias*
> - loosing focus on accountability

> Distinguishing yourself by clinging onto knowledge and mystifying your craft should no longer be a thing throughout the 2020s.
> By working behind closed doors, you miss out on a lot of valuable feedback.

# Our Pledge
## to Open Source

Pretty early in my life I was told
> "If you're good at something never do it for free."

Open Data ist nur dann Sinnvoll, wenn alle die Software zum lesen besitzen


> open source is always profitable - just not ideal for monetary gain

If you want to leave your mark, throw me an email (but make sure to include the title/s of concerning topics).

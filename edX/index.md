# Open Education Resources

Lectures in 2022 have a single flaw leading to subpar content: most of them are created closed source.
This leads to
- sporting centristic "monodisciplinary" views
- suffering from *false consensus* and *confirmation bias*
- loosing focus on accountability

Distinguishing yourself by clinging onto knowledge and mystifying your craft should no longer be a thing throughout this century. And by working behind closed doors, you miss out on a lot of valuable feedback.

# About EdX

## How this came to be
I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive, so I started revisiting and interconnecting them to a knowledge base (initially intended for an audience of one). With this website I am sharing access to this resource with you. Maybe we can get some good use out of it together.

This is not wikipedia. Here you will find memes and scientific method, definitions and concepts, sometimes personal opinion or even pure speculation. This comes with a catch:<br>
1. they're 90% german (entschuldigung) [^1]
2. they're subjective as what I believed to be true may not in fact be true
3. some information may be outdated

While some content is of my own, in other cases I am merely something of a collector / curator.

[^1]: Sometimes they’re even written in some sort of hybrid English/German style. Don't sweat it, your browser translate-feature should be able to take it.

# About OPUS
Maia edX is a knowledgebase on all things psychology made available to the public by Maia Health.
Freely accessible for the good of everybody.

# How this came to be
I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive, so I started revisiting and interconnecting them to a knowledge base (initially intended for an audience of one). With this website I am sharing access to this resource with you. Maybe we can get some good use out of it together.

This is not wikipedia. Here you will find memes and scientific method, definitions and concepts, sometimes personal opinion or even pure speculation. This comes with a catch:<br>
1. they're 90% german (entschuldigung) [^1]
2. what I hold to be true may not in fact be true
3. while some content is of my own, in other cases I am merely something of a collector / curator

[^1]: Sometimes they’re even written in some sort of hybrid English/German style. Don't sweat it, your browser translate-feature should be able to take it.

Most articles contain an abstract of the content in shortform and an extensive section in longform.
Depending on the nature of the article a version in common words is provided. It is marked <p class="label label-blue">E</p> for "Easy Language" ("E" wie "einfache Sprache").

In articles targeted specifically to mental health professionals ("PRO") look for sections called "explain like I’m five" where I'm trying to break down the content.

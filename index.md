##### what this is all about
I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive, so I started revisiting and interconnecting them to this knowledge base. With this website I am sharing access to this resource with you. Maybe we can get some good use out of it together.

This is not wikipedia. Here you will find memes and scientific method, definitions and concepts, sometimes personal opinion or even pure speculation. This comes with a catch:<br>
1. they're 90% german (entschuldigung)
2. what I hold to be true may not in fact be true
3. while some content is of my own, in other cases I am merely something of a collector/curator/publisher.

##### now go, explore 🕊
If you already know what you're looking for, search is the way to go. <br>
For everyone "just browsing" I recommend the 📚 collections linked in the menu. <br>

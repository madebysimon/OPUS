# Welcome to OPUS

I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive so I started revisiting and interconnecting them.
With this page I am sharing access to them with you. Maybe we can get some use out of them together.
 
While most views/thoughts on here are of my own, in some cases I am merely a "curator".
Please cite and give credit to any given sources or - if none are provided - link back to this page.

## start exploring
If you already know what you're looking for the quickest way is search.

For people "just browsing" I recommend the guided collections I linked in the menu.

Yours

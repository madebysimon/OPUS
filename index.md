# 👋🏼 Welcome to OPUS

#### what this is all about
I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive so I started revisiting and interconnecting them.
With this page I am sharing access to them with you. Maybe we can get some good use out of them together.

This is not wikipedia. <br>
Here you will find coexistence of memes and scientific method, definitions and concepts, sometimes even opinion or pure speculation. This comes with a catch:<br>
While most content on here is of my own, in other cases I am merely something of a collector/curator/publisher. <br>

#### you're ready to go, explore 🕊
If you already know what you're looking for, search is the way to go. <br>
For everyone "just browsing" I recommend the 📚 collections linked in the menu.

Yours <br><br>

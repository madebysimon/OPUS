# Welcome to OPUS

I grew tired of my lecture notes sitting dead on their hard drive so I started revisiting and interconnecting them.
With this page I am sharing access to them with you (yes you!). Maybe we can get some good use out of them together.
 
While most views/thoughts on here are of my own, in some cases I am merely a "curator" or something similar to a "publisher". Please cite and give credit to any given sources or - if none are provided - link back to this page.

> Pro Tip: click the ðŸ”— next to a header before sharing a page to link directly to it
  
## start exploring
If you already know what you're looking for, search is the way to go. <br>
For everyone "just browsing" I recommend the collections linked in the menu.

Yours

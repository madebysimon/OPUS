## Who is who in psychotherapy
Many actors offer services in mental health these days, so it can get confusing when it comes to expectations, who to trust or approach with what.

See my chart comparing common professions below.

in Germany treatment of mental diagnoses is allowed only
	1. **approbated health professionals** (i.e. doctors/"Ärzte" and psychotherapists/"Psychotherapeuten")
		- who are explicitly recognized and listed by the law
	2. anyone who obtains a legal permission/status of "Heilpraktiker/in für Psychotherapie"
		- after obtaining this status carrying out privately funded treatment as profession is legalized
		- is given out depending on state-level legislation, but mostly after an exam by the health department 

To become a psychotherapist - an approbated health professional  - one has to run through the steps below:

1.  **5yrs of university tuition** to be a **psychologist** or **doctor**
	- defined by national legislation
	- three options
		1. psychologists
			- title requires a masters degree or diploma in the subject of Psychology (M.Sc.)
			- **Psychologists ("Psychologen") are**
				- fully **allowed to diagnose** patients
				- generally **only allowed to treat patients for diagnoses in settings supervised by approbated health professionals**
		2. masters degree in Psychotherapy (since 2020)
		3. doctors and medical approbation
			- any approbated doctors are already allowed to treat mental (but also any other) diagnoses without further training but have to be confident enough in their ability and have to provide proof to withstand in court
-  **3-5yrs postgraduate training** to be a **psychotherapist** 
	- defined by national legislation
	- for psychological therapists
		- at Institutes (uni-integrated/non-profit/for-profit) that were paid privately by the trainee and resulted (if successful) in gaining **approbation** (until 2032), the licence to practice psychotherapy as "verfahrensspezifische/r Fachpsychotherapeut/in" commonly referred to as pyschotherapists
	- for medical psychotherapists
		- requires Approbation as doctor "Arzt" and Degree in Medicine
		- similar training, less hours of theory and treatment
	- for child and adolescent psychotherapists
		- in addition to above and depending on state-level legislation a degree in the educational field is recognized to pursue training
	- four specific methods "Fachkunde" for the treatment of adults are licensed by the national board for medical intervention (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss; G-BA)
		- Psychoanalytic Therapy
		- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
		- Depth Founded Therapy
		- Systemic Therapy
3. **State License** ("Kassensitz")
-  the costs for psychotherapeutical work with clients is refunded by the public health system
4. **mandatory ongoing further education** and evaluation
